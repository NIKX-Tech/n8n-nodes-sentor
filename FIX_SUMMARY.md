# n8n Automated Review Fix Summary

## Issue
The n8n automated review system flagged the package for:
- **Missing credential test** - Required for community node approval

## Fix Applied

### 1. Added Credential Test
**File**: `credentials/SentorApi.credentials.ts`

Added the `test` property to the `SentorApi` class:
```typescript
test: ICredentialTestRequest = {
    request: {
        baseURL: 'https://sentor.app/api',
        url: '/health',
        method: 'GET',
    },
};
```

This test:
- Uses the existing health check endpoint (`/health`)
- Validates credentials automatically when users add their API key in n8n
- Provides immediate feedback if credentials are invalid
- Follows n8n's best practices from their Node Starter Kit

### 2. Updated Type Imports
Added `ICredentialTestRequest` to the imports from `n8n-workflow`

### 3. Updated Version
- Version bumped from `0.2.1` to `0.2.2`
- CHANGELOG.md updated with fix details

## Build Status
✅ TypeScript compilation successful
✅ All files properly built in `/dist` directory
✅ No linting errors in credentials file

## Next Steps to Publish

### 1. Commit and Push Changes
```bash
cd /Users/erfan/workspace/sentor/n8n-nodes-sentor
git add .
git commit -m "fix: add credential test for n8n automated review compliance"
git push origin main
```

### 2. Publish to npm
```bash
npm publish
```

### 3. Resubmit to n8n
After publishing:
1. Go back to the n8n community node submission page
2. Check the box confirming you've made the required changes
3. The automated review should now pass

## What Changed

### Files Modified:
- `credentials/SentorApi.credentials.ts` - Added credential test
- `package.json` - Updated version to 0.2.2
- `CHANGELOG.md` - Documented the fix
- `dist/` directory - All compiled files updated

### Technical Details:
The credential test now:
- Automatically runs when users configure credentials in n8n
- Sends a GET request to `https://sentor.app/api/health`
- Uses the `x-api-key` header (via the existing `authenticate` configuration)
- Returns success/failure immediately to the user
- Does NOT consume API rate limits significantly (health check is lightweight)

## Verification
The credential test implementation follows the exact pattern from n8n's official Node Starter Kit:
https://github.com/n8n-io/n8n-nodes-starter/blob/master/credentials/ExampleCredentialsApi.credentials.ts

All changes are backwards compatible - existing users won't be affected.
